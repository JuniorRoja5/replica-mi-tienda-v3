The previous AI engineer successfully initiated the Mi Tienda application re-implementation. Initially, the focus was on a significant architectural cleanup, consolidating redundant frontend files into a single source of truth in . This was followed by a meticulous debugging effort to fix a frontend profile modal issue where input fields weren't populating or saving. The fix involved synchronizing HTML element IDs in  with JavaScript selectors in .

After these frontend fixes, the immediate problem shifted to a backend HTTP 500 error occurring when attempting to save profile data, specifically affecting avatar uploads and social links. Basic text fields like name and bio now persist correctly. The current state involves diagnosing this backend error. The AI demonstrated a methodical, diagnostic approach, requesting user input and analyzing provided error logs () to identify the root cause of the backend issue, which appears to be related to database column handling.

The primary objective is to fully re-implement the Mi Tienda application, originally a React app, into a vanilla HTML/CSS/JS frontend tightly integrated with a Laravel Blade backend. The application must maintain its original design and Spanish localization. All client-side  operations are to be migrated to RESTful API calls, encompassing user profile management, full CRUD operations for products (including drag-and-drop reordering), public product display, and various administrative sections. Authentication and data transfer between the main Laravel Blade page and the Mi Tienda iframe are managed via URL parameters with secure CSRF token handling. The Laravel backend APIs for profile and product management are expected to be functional. The immediate work involved resolving frontend data persistence in the profile modal, which has progressed to debugging a critical backend HTTP 500 error during profile updates, specifically for avatar and social links.

-   **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, Vanilla JavaScript, Iframe communication, DOM manipulation, Event Listeners.
-   **Backend**: Laravel (Blade, MVC, Routing, Controllers, Eloquent, CSRF, Artisan).
-   **Integration**: RESTful API calls (), URL Parameters for authentication.
-   **Server**: Apache/Nginx (SiteGround caching), PHP.

<code_architecture>
**Directory Structure (after cleanup):**

-   ****: Defines general web routes and *some* API routes for MiTiendaController views.
-   ****: Defines authenticated Mi Tienda API routes without CSRF middleware.
    -   **Changes Made**: Verified  on line 17.
-   ****: Handles backend logic for Mi Tienda profile and product management.
    -   **Changes Made**: The  function (lines 290-350) was modified to handle , , , , and , including slug generation and a TODO for saving base64 avatar data. This is the source of the current 500 error.
-   ****: Main Laravel Blade view, embedding  in an iframe and passing authentication data via URL parameters.
-   ****: The main HTML file for the Mi Tienda frontend.
    -   **Changes Made**: Element IDs in the profile modal were updated (e.g.,  to ,  to , and all social media input IDs to ).
-   ****: Vanilla JavaScript logic for the Mi Tienda admin frontend.
    -   **Changes Made**: Functions like , , and  were updated to use the new  IDs for JavaScript selectors ().
-   **Architectural Cleanup**: Redundant directories  and  were removed, making  the single authoritative source.

Immediately prior to this summary, the previous AI agent had successfully completed a critical architectural cleanup, consolidating all duplicated frontend assets into a single, authoritative directory: . This eliminated inconsistencies and streamlined the codebase. Subsequently, the agent resolved a significant frontend bug within the profile modal. This fix involved meticulously updating HTML element IDs in  (e.g., changing  to ,  to , and all social media input IDs to ) and then ensuring all corresponding JavaScript selectors in  (within , , and ) were updated to match the new IDs. As a result, the profile modal now correctly opens, populates with existing user data, and allows modification of basic fields like name, username, and bio, which persist upon saving and refreshing.

However, a new critical issue has arisen: when attempting to save profile changes that include avatar uploads or social media links, the backend API endpoint () returns an HTTP 500 server error. The user has provided an  file containing details of this error, confirming it affects avatar and social link persistence, while basic text fields are now correctly saved. The immediate and primary task is to diagnose and resolve this specific backend HTTP 500 error. The user is currently on a production server () and has emphasized the need for thorough analysis before proposing solutions.
