The AI engineer's primary task was to re-implement the Mi Tienda section of an application from React to a vanilla HTML/CSS/JS frontend integrated with a Laravel Blade backend. Initial progress involved developing several new static HTML pages (Dashboard, Ingresos, Diseño, Customers, Statistics) and integrating them. A critical issue arose: a production database desynchronization where the Laravel backend expected a  table, but the live system used . The engineer successfully executed a complex SQL migration to transform the data. The immediate and ongoing problem is severe  errors ( not defined) and a 404 for , indicating fundamental Laravel routing misconfigurations. The engineer has accurately diagnosed duplicate and conflicting routes in  and a lack of static file serving for the HTML frontend, and the user has just provided the correct  files for remediation.

The core objective was to refactor the Mi Tienda section from React to a vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript frontend, integrating it with a Laravel Blade backend. This involved replicating existing designs, ensuring full Spanish localization, and implementing core functionalities like product/link creation, drag-and-drop reordering, user profile editing with real-time iframe updates, and multi-tabbed forms. Design improvements and bug fixes were also crucial. Subsequent feature additions included Dashboard (statistics), Ingresos (income/orders), Diseño (design customizer with real-time Mi Tienda preview), Customers (contact management), and Statistics (graphs, product summary). All implementations required consistency with Mi Tienda aesthetics, full functionality, English code comments, responsiveness, and robust Laravel compatibility. The most recent critical problem was a production database desynchronization where the Laravel backend expected a  table, but the live database used the legacy  schema, leading to application failures.

-   **Frontend**: HTML, CSS (Vanilla, Bootstrap 5), JavaScript (Vanilla)
-   **Backend**: Laravel Blade, FastAPI (for static serving), PHP, MySQL
-   **Communication**: LocalStorage, PostMessage API
-   **Charting**: Chart.js
-   **Tools**: PuTTY, phpMyAdmin (for DB operations)
</key_technical_concepts>
<code_architecture>
The application utilizes a pure HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript frontend, initially served by a FastAPI application, now designed for deep integration with a Laravel Blade and Bootstrap 5 backend. The core logic resides within the Laravel application, interacting with a MySQL database.

Immediately prior to this summary, the AI engineer successfully completed a critical database migration. This involved analyzing old () and new () schemas and developing  to transfer 44  records to the  table, handling user ID conversion, unique slug generation, and JSON data preservation. The script was tested and deployed to production.

Following this, the engineer attempted the initial integration of the Laravel application by uploading specific files from a GitHub repository (the  folder, , , and ) to the production server.

The application subsequently encountered severe routing issues. The user reported that  showed the new frontend but with missing assets, and navigating to  resulted in a . A direct access to  resulted in a 404.

The AI engineer has precisely diagnosed these issues, noting that  shows  but not  as a direct name. Inspection of the uploaded  revealed conflicting or redundant route definitions (e.g.,  both globally and within a user group, plus a legacy ). The 404 for  indicates Laravel isn't serving these static HTML files. The latest messages confirm the environment's complexity (FastAPI serving static files alongside a separate Laravel app) and the user has provided the actual  and  files for analysis and correction.

Now that I have the current and original  files, I will proceed to clean up the  by removing conflicting route definitions and adding routes to serve the static HTML frontend files.

you already did this, you can find as web_fixed in https://github.com/JuniorRoja5/replica-mi-tienda-v3/
but you are missing all the logic of the entire project 
Example, if I go to to my main domain it redirects to https://clickmy.link/mi-tienda.html
missing the sidebar features like  https://clickmy.link/user/choose-card-type or https://clickmy.link/user/dashboard

still missing routes , please understand full laravel project from https://github.com/JuniorRoja5/vcard-saas-alejandro
