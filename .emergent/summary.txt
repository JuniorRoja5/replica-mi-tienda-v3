The previous AI engineer successfully migrated a React application's Mi Tienda section to vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, focusing on Laravel Blade integration. Initial work involved re-implementing core product features and resolving critical modal overlay bugs. Subsequently, new Dashboard and Ingresos (Orders) sections were developed, replicating React counterparts. A significant effort was dedicated to the Diseño (Design) section, including theme customization and real-time iframe preview, which necessitated extensive bug fixes for CSS conflicts, font application, and public page consistency. Most recently, Customers and Statistics sections were implemented from React. The work consistently prioritized Laravel compatibility, Spanish UI, and English code comments. The current task is a shift to debugging a critical production database desynchronization issue, requiring analysis of provided SQL dumps and a GitHub repository.

<product_requirements>
The core objective was to re-implement a React application's Mi Tienda section using vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for seamless Laravel Blade backend integration, matching existing designs and being fully functional in Spanish. Key functionalities included product/link creation, drag-and-drop reordering, user profile editing with real-time iframe updates, and multi-tabbed forms for Llamada, Curso, and Membresía. Design enhancements and bug fixes addressed modal overlay conflicts and visual inconsistencies. New sections were required: Dashboard (statistics, charts), Ingresos (income, order history), and Diseño (design customizer with theme/color/font pickers and live iframe preview). The Diseño section needed real-time interaction with Mi Tienda and consistency across public product pages. Later, Customers (contact management) and Statistics (graphs, product summary, devices) sections were added, also replicated from React. All implementations required consistency with Mi Tienda aesthetic, full functionality, English code comments, responsiveness, and Laravel compatibility.

<key_technical_concepts>
-   **HTML, CSS (Vanilla, Inline), JavaScript (Vanilla)**: Core frontend development for all migrated and new sections.
-   **Bootstrap 5**: Primarily for UI components and modals.
-   **LocalStorage**: Client-side data persistence for design settings.
-   **Real-time Iframe Updates**: Live content preview using cross-iframe communication.
-   **PostMessage API**: Essential for real-time communication between Diseño and Mi Tienda iframes.
-   **Chart.js**: JavaScript library for dynamic charts in Dashboard and Statistics.
-   **Laravel Blade Compatibility**: Fundamental architectural consideration for backend integration.
-   **FastAPI**: Python framework for the backend serving HTML pages and static assets.

<code_architecture>
The application features a pure HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript frontend, designed for integration with a Laravel Blade and Bootstrap 5 backend. The existing backend is a FastAPI application responsible for serving these static HTML pages.

<pending_tasks>
The most critical pending task is to analyze and resolve a production database desynchronization issue. The currently deployed Laravel code expects a database schema with  and related tables, but the live database still utilizes the legacy  schema, causing the application to fail.

<current_work>
Immediately prior to this summary, the AI engineer completed the development of new Customers and Statistics sections and resolved several critical bugs across the application.

**1. New Section Implementation & Bug Resolution:**
*   **Customers & Statistics Sections:** Full replication from the original React application, including UI, mock data handling, and specific components (graphs, product summary, devices for Statistics).
*   **Resolved Bugs:**
    *   **CSS Conflict in Product Previews:** The  page and  in  were modified. Hardcoded CSS was replaced with dynamic CSS variables and JavaScript listeners were added to  to receive and apply design settings from the Diseño section, ensuring real-time consistency.
    *   **Font Selection & Application:** Google Fonts links were added to  and  to ensure fonts were correctly loaded. The z-index of the font dropdown in  was adjusted to prevent overlay issues.
    *   **Public Page Design Consistency:**  was fully integrated with the design system, allowing design changes from the Diseño section to reflect on the public profile pages ().
    *   **Chart.js Loading & Execution:** In the Statistics section, Chart.js loading order was corrected, and its version was downgraded to 3.9.1 to resolve ES6 module syntax errors.
    *   **JavaScript Loading & MIME Type Issues:** Corrected JavaScript file paths in  and  to use relative paths (e.g., ). The  (FastAPI backend) was updated to include a general static file mount for  and  directories, ensuring JavaScript files were served with the correct MIME type and were executable.
    *   **Persistent Loading Spinners:** Simulated delays were removed from  and  to ensure immediate data loading.

**2. Documentation Update:** A comprehensive Laravel integration guide () and a  were created and extensively updated. These documents now cover all implemented sections, architectural details, technical integration points (Laravel Blade, API usage, CSRF tokens, authentication), and deployment considerations, providing a detailed resource for future development.

**3. Current Problem Analysis (Database Desynchronization):** The immediate focus has shifted to analyzing a critical issue reported by the user: a desynchronization between the new Laravel code (expecting a  table structure) and the production database (still using ). The AI engineer has gained access to the GitHub repository and SQL dump files ( and ) to understand the underlying schema differences and plan a resolution.
