The previous AI engineer's work, which I am now summarizing, involved an iterative process of bug fixing, feature implementation, and security hardening for the Mi Tienda application. Key initial efforts focused on integrating Quill.js, fixing reordering, and enhancing public-facing pages (, ). A critical phase involved resolving data persistence for digital products, leading to the discovery that large Base64 images were truncating API payloads and that data hydration during editing was inconsistent. This necessitated a refactoring of image upload mechanisms to use a centralized server-side endpoint. Immediately after, a critical security vulnerability resurfaced, allowing unauthenticated access to admin panel mock-up HTML files via iframes, despite previous  attempts. The conversation culminated in a user-proposed, architecturally sound Laravel Gatekeeper solution for securing these admin pages, which is the current pending major task.

<product_requirements>
The Mi Tienda application is a user profile and digital product CRUD platform built with a vanilla HTML/CSS/JS frontend and Laravel backend. Users require a public profile URL () with custom designs and persisted settings. Product/link reordering was recently implemented. Key requirements focused on integrating Quill.js for rich text editing in product descriptions (Digital Products, Consultation, Digital Courses, Recurring Memberships), including robust server-side image uploads that prevent data truncation. A comprehensive audit is needed to ensure all product fields (e.g., discount, downloadable files, custom fields, FAQs, reviews, button text, subtitle) persist, display correctly, and load for editing. In list views, only product title/subtitle should display, with prices hidden. Public product () and user profile () pages must fully reflect all product details, fetching data securely from a public API, not local storage. Crucially, critical security vulnerabilities exposing admin panels must be resolved; specifically, access to  files (admin pages) must be restricted to authenticated Laravel sessions, even when loaded via iframes. The product not found page's back button should redirect to the user's public profile.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer and user were addressing a critical security vulnerability: direct, unauthenticated access to the Mi Tienda admin panel HTML files (e.g., , ) was possible if a product was deleted, leading the product not found page's back button to an insecure location. Previous  fixes were insufficient and led to 403 errors on authenticated Laravel routes that loaded these HTML files via iframes.

The user diagnosed that  based  rules were unreliable. Consequently, the user proposed an architecturally superior Laravel Gatekeeper solution. This solution involves shifting the responsibility for serving these sensitive HTML files from Apache's  to Laravel's routing and authentication middleware.

The plan for the Laravel Gatekeeper involves four steps:
1.  Add a new Laravel route in  () within the authenticated user group.
2.  Create a  method in  to serve whitelisted HTML files.
3.  Update the  attribute of iframes in 6 Blade views () to point to this new Laravel route.
4.  Simplify the  file to strictly block all direct access to  files (except ).

This robust approach, proposed by the user and validated by the AI engineer, is the precise work that was being planned immediately before this summary. The user has requested detailed documentation of the entire process.
