The trajectory details a comprehensive debugging and refactoring effort for the Mi Tienda application. The initial problem involved profile changes not persisting, seemingly a frontend issue with  or . The AI engineer adopted a methodical, diagnostic-first approach, collaborating closely with the user, who was on a production server.

A critical finding was the architectural mess with duplicated HTML/JS files across  and , which led to an extensive cleanup phase. After consolidating the frontend assets to a single source of truth (), the focus shifted back to the profile modal. The core issue was identified as mismatched HTML element IDs and JavaScript selectors. The AI systematically corrected these IDs in both  and .

Once the frontend modal functionality was restored, a new issue emerged: a backend HTTP 500 error when attempting to save profile data, specifically affecting avatar uploads and social links, while basic text fields like name and bio now persisted. The current state is debugging this backend error. The AI demonstrated good debugging practices, systematic verification, and an iterative problem-solving approach.

The overarching goal is to fully re-implement the Mi Tienda application, originally built in React, into a vanilla HTML/CSS/JS frontend, completely integrated with a Laravel Blade backend. The application must retain its original design, Spanish localization, and migrate all client-side  operations to RESTful API calls. This includes user profile management, full CRUD operations for products (including drag-and-drop reordering), public product display, and various administrative sections. Authentication and data transfer between the main Laravel Blade page and the Mi Tienda iframe must use URL parameters with secure CSRF token handling. The Laravel backend APIs for profile and product management are expected to be functional. The immediate task involved resolving data persistence issues in the frontend profile modal, which has since transitioned into debugging a backend error during profile updates.

-   **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, Vanilla JavaScript, Iframe communication, DOM manipulation, Event Listeners.
-   **Backend**: Laravel (Blade, MVC, Routing, Controllers, Eloquent, CSRF, Artisan).
-   **Integration**: RESTful API calls (), URL Parameters for authentication,  (for fallback, being replaced).
-   **Server**: Apache/Nginx (SiteGround caching), PHP.

**Directory Structure (after cleanup):**


-   ****: Defines general web routes and *some* API routes. Contains routes for MiTiendaController views (e.g., ).
-   ****: Defines authenticated Mi Tienda API routes without CSRF middleware.
    -   **Changes Made**: Verified  is correctly defined on line 17.
-   ****: Handles backend logic for Mi Tienda profile and product management.
    -   **Changes Made**: The  function (lines 290-350) was previously modified to handle , , , , and . It includes logic for slug generation and a TODO for saving base64 avatar data. This is currently the source of the 500 error during profile updates.
-   ****: Main Laravel Blade view, embedding  as an iframe and passing authentication data via URL parameters.
-   ****: The main HTML file for the Mi Tienda frontend, loaded in an iframe.
    -   **Changes Made**: Crucial updates to synchronize element IDs in the profile modal from  to ,  to ,  to ,  to ,  to , and all social media input IDs (e.g.,  to ). A temporary timestamp for cache busting was added and then reverted.
-   ****: Contains the vanilla JavaScript logic for the Mi Tienda admin frontend.
    -   **Changes Made**: Extensive modifications to functions like , , and  to update all JavaScript selectors () from the old  IDs to the new  IDs. This corrected the frontend interaction with the profile modal.
-   **Architectural Cleanup**: Eliminated redundant directories  and  after thorough dependency mapping, establishing  as the single authoritative source for Mi Tienda frontend assets.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the previous AI agent had successfully performed a significant architectural cleanup, consolidating duplicated frontend assets from  and  into the single, correct location: . This resolved confusion stemming from multiple versions of the same files.

Following this, the agent systematically debugged and fixed a critical frontend bug where the profile modal inputs were not populating or updating correctly. This involved updating numerous HTML element IDs in  (e.g.,  to ,  to , and all social media input IDs) and then synchronizing the corresponding JavaScript selectors in  (within , , and ).

As a result of these fixes, the profile modal now opens, populates with existing data, and allows users to make changes without JavaScript errors. However, a new critical issue has emerged: when a user attempts to save profile changes (especially those involving avatar uploads or social links), the backend API endpoint () returns an HTTP 500 server error. Basic profile fields (name, username, bio) are now saved correctly and persist upon refresh, but social links and avatar changes do not. The immediate task is to diagnose and resolve this backend HTTP 500 error.
