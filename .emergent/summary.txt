The previous AI engineer successfully migrated a React application's Mi Tienda section to a pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript structure. The trajectory began with clarifying and fixing the navigation for Llamada de Consultoría products within the iframe to a dedicated public page, a task that involved significant modifications to  and . A key architectural decision was made: to keep  as a single, large file for simpler integration with the future Laravel Blade backend, deferring modularization. Subsequently, the focus shifted to implementing the Curso Digital product type. This involved analyzing a provided React codebase, defining the data structure for courses, adding global state and JavaScript logic for the new multi-tab form in , and integrating the corresponding HTML overlay in , as well as updating . The current state is in the midst of ensuring all Curso Digital JavaScript functions are correctly integrated after an initial re-test revealed missing definitions.

The core requirement was to replicate the Mi Tienda section of an existing React application using pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for seamless integration with a Laravel Blade and Bootstrap backend. The replicated application needed to be fully functional, in Spanish, and visually match provided designs.

Key functionalities implemented and requested:
-   **Mi Tienda Page**: Product/link management with creation and reordering via drag-and-drop.
-   **User Profile Editing**: Name, bio, username, avatar, with real-time iframe updates.
-   **Link/Product Management**: Create new, auto-extract metadata, support digital product types.
-   **Real-time Iframe Preview**: Mobile mockup with live updates.
-   **Producto Digital Form**: Multi-tab form (Datos, Contenido y Precio, Opciones) with fields for image, title, description, price, and custom fields.
-   **Llamada de Consultoría Form**: Multi-tab form (Datos, Contenido y Precio, Disponibilidad, Opciones) including call methods, timezone, duration, and weekly scheduling with a real-time calendar preview.
-   **Sales Page Navigation**: Products in the iframe must navigate to a dedicated sales page (). This was specifically fixed for Llamada de Consultoría during this trajectory.
-   **Edit Functionality**: Pre-populate forms for existing products/links.
-   **Purchase Modal**: Embedded modal in the public view with customer data, payment, processing states, success screen, and confetti animation.
-   **Backend Integration Prep**: Comments for Laravel integration (Stripe, webhooks, delivery).

The ongoing task is to implement the Curso Digital product type, which is similar to Producto Digital and Llamada de Consultoría, featuring tabs like Datos, Contenido y Precio, Curso (for modules/lessons), and Opciones, ensuring its page is also viewable in the iframe.

<pending_tasks>
-   Complete the implementation of the Curso Digital functionality, specifically ensuring all associated JavaScript functions are correctly defined and integrated.
-   Implement the detailed forms and associated logic for the Membresía Recurrente digital product type.
-  Refactor the  file into modular components, if the user deems it necessary after the successful integration of Laravel and a more detailed evaluation.
This is currently optional, as the developer will integrate this single view (which has multiple functionalities) into the PHP backend and the frontend with Blade.
- Well documentation in the comments is neccesary for Laravel and Blade future integration

<current_work>
The application is a functional static HTML, CSS (Bootstrap 5), and JavaScript replica of the Mi Tienda builder. It fully supports Producto Digital and Llamada de Consultoría, including multi-tab forms, real-time previews, and edit functionalities. The purchase modal is fully implemented in the public-facing iframe view.

Immediately before this summary, the AI engineer completed the fix for Llamada de Consultoría navigation, ensuring that clicking a consultation product in the iframe now correctly directs the user to  with the relevant  (consultation) and  (username) URL parameters. This involved modifying  and  in  and updating  to correctly parse the URL, display consultation-specific UI (e.g., Agendar llamada button), and validate product types.

The current work revolves around implementing the Curso Digital product type. The AI has analyzed the original React codebase to understand the structure of courses, identifying four tabs: Datos, Contenido y Precio, Curso (for modules and lessons), and Opciones. The HTML structure for the Curso Digital form overlay has been added to . In , global state for  has been added, and functions to manage the Curso Digital form logic, including handling tabs, input fields, and the complex  and  arrays, have been inserted. Furthermore,  has been updated to anticipate and handle the  product type. A recent test revealed that some of the newly added JavaScript functions for Curso Digital were not correctly defined or accessible, and the AI is currently in the process of re-verifying and re-inserting these functions.
