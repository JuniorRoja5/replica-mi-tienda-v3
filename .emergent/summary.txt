The previous AI engineer successfully migrated a complex React application's Mi Tienda section to a pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript replica, fulfilling a critical user requirement for Laravel Blade/Bootstrap compatibility. The development trajectory highlights an iterative, user-feedback-driven process. Key achievements include the implementation of core UI elements, real-time iframe previews, and robust data persistence. The engineer demonstrated strong analytical skills by deeply studying the original React codebase to replicate intricate forms for Producto Digital and Llamada de Consultoría, including multi-tab structures, dynamic fields, file handling, and unique features like scheduling. Crucially, the engineer adeptly debugged and refined functionalities such as product sales page navigation, edit button logic, and the critical purchase modal with a custom confetti animation. The work also focused on correct architectural separation between the builder and public views, with clear documentation for future backend integration.

<product_requirements>
The primary goal was to meticulously recreate the Mi Tienda section from an existing React application using pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, specifically excluding React, to ensure future compatibility with a Laravel Blade and Bootstrap backend. The application needed to be fully functional, entirely in Spanish, and visually replicate provided design cues.

Core functionalities requested and implemented:
-   **Mi Tienda Page**: Display product/link management with a Crear Nuevo button and listing.
-   **Drag and Drop**: Reordering products/links with real-time iframe preview.
-   **User Profile Editing**: Name, bio, username, and avatar upload, with real-time iframe updates.
-   **Social Media Editing**: Dynamic display of icons based on entered usernames.
-   **Link/Product Management**: Create new links/products, auto-extract favicon/title from URLs, support manual overrides, and integrate digital product type selection.
-   **Real-time Iframe Preview**: Mobile mockup showing live updates.
-   **Producto Digital Form**: Implementation of a multi-tab form (Datos, Contenido y Precio, Opciones) with fields for product image, title, subtitle, description, price, discounts, and custom fields.
-   **Sales Page Navigation**: Products in the iframe should navigate to a dedicated sales page ().
-   **Edit Functionality**: Edit buttons on main products/links should open their respective forms pre-populated.
-   **Purchase Modal**: Implement an embedded purchase modal (without leaving the platform) with customer data, payment section, processing states, success screen, and a confetti animation. This modal must be part of the public-facing view (iframe), not the builder interface.
-   **Llamada de Consultoría Form**: Implementation of a multi-tab form (Datos, Contenido y Precio, Disponibilidad, Opciones) including specific features like call methods (Google Meet, Zoom, custom link), timezone selection, duration, minimum notice, buffer time, booking period, and weekly scheduling with multiple time intervals.
-   **Backend Integration Prep**: Add comments in the code to guide Laravel backend integration for features like Stripe payments, webhooks, and automatic product delivery.

<code_architecture>
The application's code architecture transitioned from a React foundation to a pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript structure. The core logic resides in a main HTML file, a primary JavaScript file, and a dedicated CSS file.



**Key Files and Their Importance:**

-   :
    -   **Summary**: The primary HTML file for the Mi Tienda builder interface. It hosts the profile editor, product/link management, modals, and the iframe preview.
    -   **Changes**: Initially created as the static replica. Extensive additions were made for the Producto Digital and Llamada de Consultoría forms, their respective multi-tab structures, and the purchase modal's HTML (later refined for logical separation). Includes Bootstrap, , and .

<current_work>
The application is a robust, fully functional static HTML, CSS (Bootstrap 5), and JavaScript replica of the Mi Tienda builder. It now supports two complex digital product types, Producto Digital and Llamada de Consultoría, with their respective multi-tabbed forms and real-time previews.

**Current State Features:**
-   **Profile and Link Management**: Users can edit profile details (name, bio, username, avatar) and manage external links with auto-extracted metadata. Drag-and-drop reordering is fully functional.
-   **Producto Digital Form**: A complete 3-tab form (Datos, Contenido y Precio, Opciones) allows users to define digital products. It includes image uploads, rich text descriptions, price management (with discounts), and custom fields.
-   **Llamada de Consultoría Form**: A comprehensive 4-tab form (Datos, Contenido y Precio, Disponibilidad, Opciones) for scheduling consultations. It features configurable call methods (Google Meet, Zoom, custom), detailed time settings (timezone, duration, buffer, booking period), and a dynamic weekly schedule with multiple time intervals. The iframe shows a real-time calendar preview during editing.
-   **Real-time Previews**: The mobile mockup iframe dynamically updates based on user input for profile, links, and product details. During product editing, the iframe switches to a simulated public sales page view () to show product details, and during consultation editing, it shows the scheduling calendar.
-   **Edit Functionality**: Edit buttons for both links and digital products (Producto Digital, Llamada de Consultoría) correctly open the respective forms, pre-populating all fields for seamless modification.
-   **Purchase Modal (Public View)**: A fully implemented, embedded purchase modal appears for digital products when accessed from the simulated public sales page within the iframe. It includes customer information fields, payment details (simulated), processing states, and a spectacular confetti animation on success. This modal is architecturally separated to appear only on the public-facing vCard view, not the builder platform.
-   **Data Persistence**: All user and product data is stored in , with error handling for quota limits.
-   **Laravel Integration Preparation**: Extensive comments have been added throughout the JavaScript and HTML files, detailing the necessary backend API endpoints and integration points for Laravel (e.g., Stripe payments, webhooks, order creation, automatic delivery).
-   **Bug Fixes**: All previously reported issues (purchase button positioning, iframe preview not updating correctly during editing, localStorage quota exceeded, text visibility in purchase modal, edit button functionality) have been addressed and validated.

Lo acabo de guardar y hacer push en github 
lo acabo de probar y parece que todo funciona correctamente. 
Lo que falta es la logica de , cuando creas el producto y se ve desde el iframe, al hacer clic, nos lleve a https://dominio/u/usuario del apartado de llamada de consultoria realizado. 

Despues de esto y que lo confirmemos, podemos continuar con Curso Digital
