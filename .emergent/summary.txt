The trajectory details an intensive debugging and refactoring session for the Mi Tienda application, migrating from React to Laravel Blade/JS/HTML. The core problem involved links appearing inactive despite being marked active, stemming from a desynchronization between frontend and backend. Initially, the AI engineer identified a  issue returning empty arrays, which was later traced to frontend temporary IDs and a timing/transaction problem in . The breakthrough came from realizing the frontend wasn't correctly synchronizing with the backend's saved data, particularly regarding the  field. A two-pronged fix was implemented: adding a  field to the  backend response and synchronizing the  checkbox in the  frontend function. This resolved the active/inactive display and edit issues. Subsequently, a comprehensive cleanup of  and  was performed, removing all debugging  statements, which led to a minor syntax error quickly resolved. The work concluded with a request for detailed documentation for future development.

<product_requirements>
The Mi Tienda application is undergoing a migration from React to a vanilla HTML/CSS/JS frontend with a Laravel Blade backend, requiring the preservation of its original design, Spanish localization, and all functionalities (user profile, CRUD for products with reordering, public product display, admin sections). Client-side  operations are to be migrated to RESTful API calls, with authentication and data transfer via URL parameters and CSRF tokens. Laravel backend APIs must ensure data persistence.

**Current Status & Resolved Problems:**
Frontend assets are consolidated, and profile management works. Key issues resolved include: link image persistence,  for edit/delete buttons, Edition creates duplicate and Product not found bugs (via  refactor and modal cleanup). Link deletion now persists. The  table has a  column, correctly saved by . The most recent resolution fixed the inactive link display by ensuring the backend's  returns the  field, and the frontend's  correctly synchronizes the  checkbox. All temporary debugging s have been removed for production readiness.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary, the AI engineer successfully resolved a critical frontend-backend synchronization bug in the Mi Tienda application. The issue involved new links appearing as inactive and the edit modal's active/inactive checkbox not reflecting the true state.

The problem was diagnosed as a two-fold inconsistency:
1.  **Backend ():** The  function, while correctly setting an internal  boolean, was not explicitly providing a  string field in its API response, which the frontend's  expected.
2.  **Frontend ():** The  function was not initializing the  checkbox based on the product's  when the modal was opened. Additionally, an earlier fix for the edition creates duplicates bug by reloading products after  was correctly implemented but highlighted the  display issue.

The fixes applied were:
*   **Backend:** In , line 558, within the  function's  map,  was added to ensure the backend always sends the  string field.
*   **Frontend:** In , line 3109, within the  function,  was added to synchronize the checkbox with the product's .

After resolving the functional bugs, a thorough cleanup was performed across  and , removing all temporary  statements, comments, and debug remnants to ensure a clean and secure production-ready codebase. A minor syntax error caused by an orphaned object due to log removal was also swiftly corrected. All checks confirm the application functions perfectly with no unexpected console output.
