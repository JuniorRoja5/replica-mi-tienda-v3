The AI engineer successfully transformed a React app's Mi Tienda section into a pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript structure. The trajectory started by fixing the Llamada de Consultoría navigation to a dedicated public page (), involving  modifications. A key decision was made to keep  monolithic for Laravel Blade integration. Following this, the Curso Digital product type was implemented, requiring extensive additions to  (form overlay) and  (global state, multi-tab logic, module management). The AI meticulously debugged missing JavaScript functions and HTML ID mismatches for Curso Digital to achieve full functionality. Subsequently, Membresía Recurrente was implemented following a similar pattern, involving new HTML and JavaScript for its unique billing settings and tabs. The final phase focused on design enhancement, fixing a duplicate product entry, and addressing responsiveness issues, leading to significant CSS refactoring and debugging persistent modal overlays. The work concluded with acknowledged mobile/tablet overlay issues deferred to a later phase.

The primary goal was to replicate an existing React application's Mi Tienda section in pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for integration with a Laravel Blade backend. The application needed to be fully functional, in Spanish, and visually match provided designs.

Implemented functionalities include:
-   **Mi Tienda Page**: Product/link creation, reordering (drag-and-drop).
-   **User Profile Editing**: Name, bio, username, avatar with real-time iframe updates.
-   **Link/Product Management**: Create new, auto-extract metadata, support digital product types.
-   **Real-time Iframe Preview**: Mobile mockup with live updates.
-   **Producto Digital Form**: Multi-tab form (Datos, Contenido y Precio, Opciones).
-   **Llamada de Consultoría Form**: Multi-tab form (Datos, Contenido y Precio, Disponibilidad, Opciones), including call methods, timezone, duration, and scheduling. This involved a critical fix to ensure navigation from the iframe to .
-   **Curso Digital Form**: Multi-tab form (Datos, Contenido y Precio, Curso, Opciones) with module/lesson management. This was fully implemented and tested.
-   **Membresía Recurrente Form**: Multi-tab form (Datos, Contenido y Precio, Opciones) with specific billing settings (frequency, end date). This was also fully implemented.
-   **Sales Page Navigation**: Products in the iframe navigate to  with relevant parameters.
-   **Edit Functionality**: Pre-populate forms for existing products/links.
-   **Purchase Modal**: Embedded in public view with payment states.
-   **Backend Integration Prep**: Comments for Laravel integration.
-   **Design Improvement**: Enhance visual style to match original React app (white background, soft tones, shadows, gradients, rounded corners, generous spacing).
-   **Bug Fixes**: Address duplication issues and responsive design problems, particularly concerning modal overlays.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary, the AI engineer was focused on addressing user-reported issues related to the application's visual style and responsiveness, particularly concerning modal overlays and product visualizations.

The work proceeded as follows:
1.  **Duplication Fix**: Identified and successfully removed a duplicate Membresía Recurrente entry in the product type selector within .
2.  **Initial Responsiveness Attempt**: A new CSS file, , was created and linked to  and  to address mobile layout issues. Initial tests showed some improvement but persistent problems with modal positioning and Z-index.
3.  **Design Enhancement**: A new CSS file, , was created and linked. This file aimed to overhaul the application's visual design to match the original React app, introducing white backgrounds, subtle shadows, gradients, rounded corners, and improved typography. This successfully transformed the desktop view, aligning it with the desired aesthetics. A critical fix involved overriding a hardcoded blue gradient in the  CSS directly in  by creating more specific rules in .
4.  **Persistent Overlay Debugging**: Despite CSS changes, modals continued to exhibit issues on mobile/tablet (not opening, strange dark backgrounds, ugly scrollbars, superimposition). Attempts to implement a  JavaScript function in  to close all overlays on load were unsuccessful. The AI tried to click various elements to force close them, but the problem persisted.
5.  **Re-evaluation of Modal Issues**: The AI determined that the modals were not opening at all in mobile/tablet views, indicating a deeper JavaScript issue (event handlers not firing, persistent blocking overlays) rather than just CSS positioning. It also noted ugly scrollbars and dark backgrounds in overlays.

The current state is that desktop functionality and design are perfect, including Membresía Recurrente and Curso Digital. However, the persistent overlay/modal issues on mobile/tablet remain, with the AI confirming they are likely JavaScript-related and more complex than simple CSS fixes. The user has agreed to defer these mobile issues to a later phase. The user's last request was to improve the style and visual of the entire project, which has been largely accomplished for desktop, but bugs related to this change (incorrect background, duplicated iframe, bad rounded corners) were reported and subsequently fixed. The very last message from the user indicates new issues related to modals and UI elements (dark backgrounds, ugly scrollbars). The AI is currently attempting to debug these new issues related to modal backdrops and scrollbars.
