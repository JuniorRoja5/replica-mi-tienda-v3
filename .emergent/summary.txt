The trajectory details the work of an AI engineer on the Mi Tienda application, primarily focused on migrating it from React to a Laravel Blade, vanilla JS/HTML stack. The main challenge identified and addressed was the persistent issue of link image (especially auto-extracted favicons) disappearing upon page reload. Initially, the AI engineer misdiagnosed the problem as being solely within the  backend function. However, an external analysis, validated by the AI engineer, correctly pinpointed the root cause to a frontend JavaScript function, , which was failing to correctly preserve existing image URLs when saving the application state.

A significant hurdle throughout this process was a persistent discrepancy in the  file versions between the AI engineer's local environment and the user's production server. The AI engineer attempted to apply the frontend fix and a related backend fix to . While backend tests passed, the frontend code's actual state remained unverified due to the file version mismatch. The conversation concludes with the user providing the definitive, correct  file for the AI engineer to use.

The Mi Tienda application is being re-implemented from React to a vanilla HTML/CSS/JS frontend with a Laravel Blade backend, maintaining its original design, Spanish localization, and functionalities. This includes user profile management (name, bio, avatar, social links), full CRUD operations for products with reordering, a public-facing product display, and various administrative sections. All client-side  operations must migrate to RESTful API calls. Authentication and data transfer between the Laravel Blade page and the Mi Tienda iframe use URL parameters, including CSRF token handling. The Laravel backend APIs for profile and product/link management must be fully functional, ensuring data persistence across page reloads.

**Current Implementation Status & Problems Encountered:**
Frontend assets are consolidated. Profile modal works, and profile data, including avatar and social links, persists due to backend fixes (HTTP 500 errors related to column size and base64 processing resolved, avatar images integrate with ). The critical issue remaining is link image persistence: auto-extracted link images (favicons) and previous manual images disappear on page reload. This was traced to the  frontend function not correctly handling existing image URLs, causing the backend's  to re-insert links with  image data, and  subsequently returning empty s.

<current_work>
Immediately prior to this summary, the AI engineer was addressing the critical bug where images for auto-extracted links (favicons) disappeared upon page reload, while manually uploaded link images persisted. The root cause was identified as a flaw in the frontend  function in . This function was incorrectly sending empty  and  payloads for existing links during a save operation, causing the backend's  (which deletes and re-inserts all links) to store  in the  database field. Consequently,  would return an empty  for these links.

The AI engineer *claimed* to have implemented the fix for  (to correctly preserve existing image URLs by sending their relative path in the  field) and also fixed  in  to correctly use . Backend tests subsequently passed, confirming the  fix.

However, a critical discrepancy emerged: the user indicated that the  file the AI engineer was working with was an outdated, much shorter version (1646 lines) compared to the user's production file (~2868 lines, then confirmed to be 5810 lines). This means the intended frontend fix for  was likely applied to the wrong base file, leading to confusion and the user stating the AI was not centered. The last action was the user providing the definitively correct and complete  file (5810 lines) for the AI engineer to use.
