The trajectory details the work of an AI engineer transitioning a React Mi Tienda section to vanilla HTML/CSS/JS, integrating it with a Laravel Blade backend. The initial focus was on re-implementing existing features and developing new sections (Dashboard, Ingresos, Diseño, Customers, Statistics), resolving various UI and integration bugs. The immediate, critical task became a database desynchronization issue: Laravel expected a  table, but production used . The engineer successfully analyzed SQL dumps, devised, tested, and executed a robust SQL migration script, transforming  data to the  schema while preserving all records and handling complex data conversions. This migration was completed on production. The current challenge involves integrating the new Laravel backend with the HTML frontend, specifically resolving severe  errors ( not defined) and a 404 for , which have been precisely diagnosed as conflicts and misconfigurations within the Laravel  file.

The primary objective was to refactor and re-implement the Mi Tienda section from a React application to vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for integration with a Laravel Blade backend. This re-implementation required matching existing designs, full Spanish localization, and core functionalities such as product/link creation, drag-and-drop reordering, user profile editing with real-time iframe updates, and multi-tabbed forms. Design improvements and bug fixes, particularly for modal overlays and visual inconsistencies, were also necessary. Subsequent feature additions included Dashboard (statistics, charts), Ingresos (income, order history), Diseño (design customizer with theme/color/font pickers and live iframe preview, requiring real-time interaction with Mi Tienda and design consistency across public product pages), Customers (contact management), and Statistics (graphs, product summary, devices) — all replicated from the original React app. All implementations demanded consistency with the Mi Tienda aesthetic, full functionality, English code comments, responsiveness, and robust Laravel compatibility. The most recent and critical problem identified was a production database desynchronization where the updated Laravel code expected a  table, while the live database still utilized the legacy  schema, causing application failures.

-   **Frontend**: HTML, CSS (Vanilla, Bootstrap 5), JavaScript (Vanilla)
-   **Backend**: Laravel Blade, FastAPI (for static file serving), PHP
-   **Database**: MySQL (schema migration, SQL scripting)
-   **Communication**: LocalStorage, PostMessage API (for iframe previews)
-   **Charting**: Chart.js
-   **Tools**: PuTTY, phpMyAdmin (for DB operations)
</key_technical_concepts>

<code_architecture>
The application utilizes a pure HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript frontend, initially served by a FastAPI application, and is designed for deep integration with a Laravel Blade and Bootstrap 5 backend. The core logic now resides within the Laravel application, which interacts with a MySQL database.

**Key Files and Their Importance (with recent changes):**

-   : Main Mi Tienda builder UI. **Changes:** Added Google Fonts links to ensure fonts are available for customization.
-   : Public-facing sales page for individual products. **Changes:** Refactored to use dynamic CSS variables () and JavaScript to load/apply design settings, resolving CSS conflicts and ensuring design consistency with Diseño customizations.
-   : Central JavaScript for Mi Tienda functionality. **Changes:** Implemented listeners for , , and custom events to receive design updates from Diseño. Modified  to use  for dynamic styling in sales page previews and updated  for sales preview buttons.
-    & : Dashboard section for overall statistics.
-    & : Income/Orders section for tracking transactions.
-   : Design customization page. **Changes:** Added Google Fonts links to correctly load custom fonts.
-   : Manages Diseño UI logic. **Changes:** Modified  to send design updates to Mi Tienda via . Enhanced  for cross-window/tab communication. Adjusted z-index for font dropdown to prevent overlay issues.
-    & : **NEW FILES (Replication).** Replicate the Customers section for contact management. **Changes:** Removed simulated delays for immediate data loading and corrected JavaScript import paths to relative  paths for proper file loading.
-    & : **NEW FILES (Replication).** Replicate Statistics (graphs, product summary, devices). **Changes:** Removed simulated delays and updated Chart.js to version 3.9.1 to resolve ES6 module errors. Corrected JavaScript import paths to relative  paths.
-   : Backend FastAPI application. **Changes:** Added routes for  and  pages. Configured static file serving for general  and  directories to resolve MIME type issues for assets.
-   : **NEW FILE.** Comprehensive Laravel integration guide, detailing all implemented sections and their integration points.
-   : **NEW FILE.** Documents all backend API routes for development reference.
-   : SQL dump representing the *new* expected database schema from the Laravel project. Used for schema comparison.
-   : SQL dump representing the *old* production database schema. Used for schema comparison.
-   : **NEWLY CREATED.** The final, robust SQL script used to migrate data from the old  table to the new  table in the production database. It handles user ID conversion, unique slug generation, and preserves all data as JSON.
-   : **NEWLY UPLOADED.** The Laravel Eloquent model that defines the structure and interaction with the  database table. Crucial for Laravel to correctly interact with the migrated data.
-   : **NEWLY UPLOADED.** The Laravel controller responsible for handling requests related to the  (e.g., listing, creating, updating cards).
-   : **NEWLY UPLOADED.** This file defines all web routes for the Laravel application. It is currently the source of routing conflicts () as it contains multiple and inconsistent definitions for -related routes.

<current_work>
Immediately prior to this summary, the AI engineer completed the critical task of migrating the production database schema.
1.  **Database Migration**: The engineer analyzed the old () and new () database schemas, identifying the need to transition from  to . A custom SQL migration script () was developed. This script efficiently migrated all 44 existing  records to the new  table, ensuring data integrity by converting string  to integers, generating unique  for existing duplicate entries, and preserving all auxiliary data within a JSON column in the  table.
2.  **Migration Testing and Deployment**: The migration script was rigorously tested on a staging database, debugging initial issues related to data import and temporary table errors. Once validated as 100% successful, it was deployed to the production database (). The migration completed successfully, with a minor cosmetic  not affecting data integrity.
3.  **Initial Laravel Frontend Integration Attempt**: Following the successful database migration, the engineer proceeded with integrating the Laravel application. Specific files from the GitHub repository ( folder, , , and ) were uploaded to the production server.
4.  **Current Problem - Routing Conflicts**: Upon uploading the new Laravel files, the application experienced severe routing issues. The user reported:
    *   Accessing  showed the new frontend but lacked the expected original sidebar, suggesting incomplete integration or missing assets.
    *   Navigating to  and clicking Show details from  resulted in a . This indicates that the application's views are attempting to link to a route named , but Laravel's route definitions do not expose it under this exact name.
    *   Directly accessing  resulted in a 404 error, confirming a lack of proper routing for static HTML files directly within Laravel.
5.  **Diagnosis**: The AI engineer has initiated a precise diagnosis, identifying that the  output shows  (among other  routes) but not  as a direct name. This, combined with an inspection of the uploaded  file, points to conflicting or redundant route definitions (e.g.,  both globally and within a user group, plus a legacy ) that are causing the  errors. The  for  indicates that the frontend's static files are not being served correctly by Laravel's routing.
