The trajectory details a comprehensive debugging and feature implementation process for the Mi Tienda application, focusing primarily on Stripe payments and digital product delivery. The initial problem involved a non-functional digital product file upload and download system, leading to a critical Digital product file not found error. The AI engineer, guided by the user's detailed documentation and real-time server investigations via  commands, systematically identified and resolved multiple issues across the frontend (JavaScript, HTML DOM) and backend (Laravel controller, routes).

Key resolutions included implementing a robust file upload mechanism using FormData (instead of an initial, problematic base64 approach), restructuring HTML to correctly display upload progress and delete buttons, fixing JavaScript DOM manipulation errors, and ensuring the Stripe payment modal closes properly after successful transactions. The process involved several iterative debugging steps, addressing syntax errors, and correcting logical flaws in how UI elements were updated and how data flowed between frontend and backend. The latest efforts are focused on correcting price discounting inconsistencies in Stripe payments and enhancing custom field management for product creation.

The Mi Tienda application aims to facilitate the sale of various product types (digital products, consultations, courses, memberships) through public profiles with extensive customization and robust media uploads. The core objective is Fase 2: Integraci贸n de Stripe, enabling secure payments using Stripe Elements, providing a confetti animation on success, and automating content delivery (e.g., email with download links).

**Implemented functionality includes:**
- Secure Stripe payment intent creation and webhook handling.
- A digital product download system with unique, expiring, and limited-use tokens stored in a  table.
- Frontend payment modal with Stripe Elements and dynamic Descargar ahora button for digital products.
- Backend endpoints for product CRUD, Stripe public key retrieval, and digital product delivery/download.
- Functionality to upload and delete digital product files physically on the server, with correct UI feedback in the product creation/edit modal.
- Correct closing of both the Stripe payment modal and the success modal post-transaction.

The system still needs to resolve price inconsistencies in discounted products and improve the flexibility and functionality of custom fields for all product types.

<key_technical_concepts>
- **Frontend**: Vanilla JavaScript (Fetch API, DOM manipulation, , ), HTML, CSS.
- **Backend**: Laravel (Controllers, API routes,  facade,  helper,  validation, ), MySQL.
- **Payments**: Stripe Elements (PaymentIntent API), Webhooks.
- **File Management**: Server-side file storage, unique naming, deletion.
- **Security**: CSRF token handling for API calls, secure token generation.

**Directory Structure (Simplified relevant parts):**


-   ****
    -   **Importance**: Central backend for Mi Tienda products, payments, and file handling.
    -   **Changes**:
        -   : **NEW METHOD** (added after line 982). Handles POST requests for digital product file uploads. Validates  (max 50MB), generates a unique filename (), stores it in , and returns the relative path ().
        -   : **NEW METHOD** (added after ). Handles DELETE requests to remove a physical file from the server based on .
        -   : Modified (lines 1107-1113) to correctly calculate  by robustly checking  and  from both product root and meta data.
        -   : Optimized to also serve download URLs for digital products using .
        -   : Generates unique 64-character download tokens, stores them in  with expiration (7 days) and download limits (3), and logs the token creation.
        -   : Validates the token, checks download limits, and serves either local files (from ) or redirects to remote URLs.
-   ****
    -   **Importance**: Defines all web and API routes.
    -   **Changes**:
        -   : **NEW ROUTE** (added after line 641). Maps to  for handling digital product file uploads.
        -   : **NEW ROUTE** (added after ). Maps to .
        -   : Route for  to serve digital products.
-   ****
    -   **Importance**: Frontend JavaScript for product creation/editing and UI interactions.
    -   **Changes**:
        -   : **Completely rewritten** (around line 2067). Now uses  for actual file uploads (instead of simulation). Correctly updates UI (shows spinner, then filename and delete button) and handles errors. Fixed  by ensuring DOM elements are updated correctly and the  block is syntactically sound.
        -   : **Modified** (around line 2125). Now sends a  request to the backend to physically remove the file, then resets the UI. Fixed  by adding the correct  block structure.
        -   : **NEW FUNCTION** (added after line 2130). Handles image uploads for product images, reusing  backend. This was added to resolve .
        -   **UI Update Logic**: Added logic in product edit/load functions (e.g., around lines 3711 and 4968) to correctly display the uploaded  by extracting just the filename.
        -   **Custom Fields (Initial State)**:  array initialized with default Nombre completo and Correo electr贸nico for all product types, but user intends to remove these and make them fully user-definable.
-   ****
    -   **Importance**: Frontend page for public product display and purchase.
    -   **Changes**:
        -   : **Modified** (around line 1222). Now explicitly calls  to ensure the Stripe payment modal closes completely after a successful transaction. The  ID was also confirmed to be  to match  logic.
        -   **HTML Structure**:  div was moved outside  (around lines 2932-2952) to be a sibling, not a child, ensuring it is visible when  is hidden.
</code_architecture>

<pending_tasks>
-   Correct price discounting inconsistencies where the frontend UI shows a discounted price, but Stripe charges the original price.
-   Remove default Nombre completo and Correo electr贸nico custom fields from product creation/edit forms and allow users to create/delete custom fields freely.
-   Make custom fields in the public product page editable by the end-user for data collection.
-   Create missing email view templates for , , , and .
-   Implement specific content unlocking logic for Consultation, Course, and Membership products.
-   Implement Stripe subscriptions for recurring membership payments.

Immediately before this summary, the AI engineer was working on the Precio con Descuento No Sincronizado (Price with Discount Not Synchronized) bug and Custom Fields issues.

For the **discount price issue**, it was identified that the frontend  correctly displays the discounted price, but the  endpoint in the backend was not correctly using this discounted price for the Stripe transaction. The  method in  (lines 1107-1113) was updated. The previous logic () was too permissive and could fail if the discounted price was . The fix involved a more robust check:

This ensures the  sent to Stripe correctly reflects the discounted amount if  is true and  is greater than zero, drawing from both the product's root properties and its  data for compatibility.

The next issue, **Custom Fields**, was just initiated. The user reported that Nombre completo and Correo electr贸nico fields are pre-filled and uneditable in the admin product creation/edit form () and also not editable by the end-user on the public page (). The AI engineer's analysis confirmed the hardcoded default fields in , , , and  and that  prevents their deletion. The current task is to address these custom field behaviors.
