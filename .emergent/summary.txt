The AI engineer's work began by re-implementing Mi Tienda from React to vanilla JS/HTML/Laravel Blade, focusing on profile and product management. Initial work involved frontend cleanup and fixing a profile modal, followed by extensive debugging of backend HTTP 500 errors during profile updates, which were resolved by migrating  to  and implementing  for base64 images, integrating with the  model.

Subsequent issues with product image uploads and persistence led to similar backend adjustments. A significant part of the trajectory involved battling persistent JavaScript syntax errors in  and PHP errors in , often introduced by imprecise modifications. The user repeatedly provided correct versions of critical files (, , various PHP controllers, , , , ) for the AI to analyze and install, aiming to restore functionality and aesthetics.

The current challenge centers on link and product image persistence. While profile management is now robust, links created on the frontend would disappear upon page reload. This was traced through multiple layers: initial frontend JavaScript only used local storage, then backend API calls failed due to missing  validation or incorrect card creation logic in . Finally, the critical issue was identified: the  API call (responsible for fetching links and products upon page load) returns an empty  for auto-extracted link images, preventing their persistence on the frontend. The 's  then  logic, combined with inconsistent frontend  payload for non-base64 images, caused images to disappear for older links.

<product_requirements>
The Mi Tienda application, originally a React app, is being re-implemented using a vanilla HTML/CSS/JS frontend integrated with a Laravel Blade backend. The re-implementation must maintain the original design, Spanish localization, and all existing functionalities. All client-side  operations must be migrated to RESTful API calls for:
-   User profile management (including name, bio, avatar, social links).
-   Full CRUD operations for products, including drag-and-drop reordering.
-   A public-facing product display.
-   Various administrative sections.

Authentication and data transfer between the main Laravel Blade page and the Mi Tienda iframe occur via URL parameters, including secure CSRF token handling. The Laravel backend APIs for both profile and product/link management are expected to be fully functional and data must persist across page reloads.

**Current Implementation Status & Problems Encountered:**
-   Architectural cleanup: Frontend assets are consolidated in .
-   Frontend profile modal: Opens, populates, and allows modifications; profile data (including avatar and social links) persists.
-   Backend profile update: HTTP 500 errors related to column size and base64 processing were resolved, and avatar images now integrate with .
-   Link persistence: Initial local-only saving, then API call issues, then backend  logic for card creation, and finally a problem where auto-extracted link images and previous manual images do not persist upon page reload. The  endpoint in  is found to return an empty  for auto-extracted link images, and the  logic (delete all, insert all) combined with inconsistent frontend payload for  causes data loss for existing links.

<code_architecture>
**Directory Structure:**

-   ****: This file now includes comprehensive routes for  (UI),  (authenticated API), and  (public API), with correct controller imports.
-   ****: This controller handles the main UI pages, returning Blade views for different sections (dashboard, ingresos, diseno, etc.). It uses the  trait for configuration.
-   ****: This is the core backend logic for profile and product/link management.
    -    function: Correctly handles base64 avatar images, saves to , updates  model, and creates  entry.
    -    function: Was modified to also fetch  and combine them with  before formatting for the frontend. **Current state:** It returns an empty  for auto-extracted links but correct URLs for manual image uploads.
    -    function: Was modified to include logic to get or create a  by  if it doesn't exist, remove  validation, and handle base64 image processing for  (saving to  field in ). **Current state:** It still deletes all existing links () and inserts the new set received in the payload, which leads to data loss if the frontend payload is incomplete.
-   ****: Provides a public API () to retrieve full store data (card, links, products, galleries, etc.) for public display.
-   ****: Eloquent model for the  table, correctly associated with  and used for avatar storage.
-   ** (root)**: Was updated to include specific rewrite rules for Mi Tienda's public and user-authenticated routes, ensuring correct routing by Laravel.
-   ****: The main frontend HTML file. Its structure was aligned with  to ensure correct DOM element IDs (, , , ) for various modals and overlays.
-   ****: A new HTML file for displaying individual public products, featuring dynamic data loading, design integration, and purchase functionality.
-   ****: The central JavaScript file.
    -   Initial state had JavaScript errors due to mismatched DOM IDs with HTML, which were resolved.
    -   : Was modified to be  and use .
    -   : A new function added to send the complete  (links and products) to .
    -   : A new function to handle saving of individual links. **Current state:** It constructs a payload containing *all* links from  and sends them to . It tries to only send base64  for new links, to prevent overwriting existing image paths.
    -   , , : Functions responsible for fetching initial data.  was modified to fetch from  (which also returns products and links) and parse them into .
    -   : A new async function to convert external image URLs (like favicons) into base64, using a CORS proxy.
-   **Database Tables**: , ,  had , ,  columns changed to  for base64 image data. The  column in  is used for link images.

</code_architecture>

<pending_tasks>
-   Ensure  and  functions also save product images to the  table (this was deferred by user).
-   Address the link reordering functionality (order is not saved).
-   Fix  to correctly return the  for auto-extracted link images.
-   Re-evaluate  logic to prevent overwriting existing link image data ( field) when only a subset of s (e.g., new base64) are sent from the frontend.

<current_work>
Immediately prior to this summary request, the AI engineer was focused on resolving the critical issue of link image persistence. After numerous iterations, the system now successfully persists manually uploaded images for links. However, a specific problem remains: images for **auto-extracted links (favicons)** still disappear upon page reload.

The debugging process revealed the following:
1.  **Backend ** still fundamentally operates by deleting all existing links for a card and then re-inserting the set of links received in the payload.
2.  **Frontend ** was modified to collect *all* links from  and send them. It also attempts to conditionally send  (only if it's base64) to avoid overwriting existing image paths in the backend.
3.  **Backend ** (responsible for loading data on page refresh) is the source of the problem for auto-extracted images. The user's latest network tab output (Chat 530) explicitly shows:
    *   For a manually uploaded image link (e.g., Cavernatecnologica-con-imagen-local):  (a full URL to the uploaded image). This image correctly persists.
    *   For an auto-extracted image link (e.g., Batcomunicacion-con-imagen-automatica):  (an empty string). This means  is *not* retrieving the  path from the  table for these types of links, leading to the image disappearing on reload.
4.  The  field in the database for auto-extracted links is , even after attempts to convert external URLs to base64 via  and save them. This suggests the conversion or saving process for auto-extracted images to the backend's  field is failing, or the  delete-then-insert is clearing it if not properly repopulated by the frontend.

The current state is that manual link images persist, but auto-extracted ones do not. This is because  is not consistently returning the image path for auto-extracted links from the  field.
