<analysis>
The previous AI engineer's work primarily focused on refactoring the Mi Tienda section to vanilla HTML/CSS/JS, integrating it with a Laravel Blade backend. Initial successes included developing static HTML pages and executing a critical SQL migration from  to  table. However, significant  errors and 404s for static files plagued the integration. The engineer initially misdiagnosed and *over-corrected* the  by drastically truncating it. User feedback corrected this, revealing the actual production Laravel path. The engineer then correctly identified the core issue as duplicate and conflicting Laravel routes in the provided  (from the user's developer) and the absence of proper routing for the new static HTML frontend. The current state is the engineer providing a precise script to clean up these duplicate routes and correctly inject the Mi Tienda API routes into the production  file, awaiting user execution and verification.

The primary objective was to refactor the Mi Tienda application section from a React frontend to a vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript implementation, tightly integrated with a Laravel Blade backend. This refactoring included replicating existing designs, ensuring full Spanish localization, and implementing core features such as product/link creation, drag-and-drop reordering, user profile editing with real-time iframe updates, and multi-tabbed forms. Design improvements and bug fixes were also critical. Subsequent required feature additions encompassed Dashboard (statistics), Ingresos (income/orders), Diseño (design customizer with real-time Mi Tienda preview), Customers (contact management), and Statistics (graphs, product summary). All new implementations needed to maintain consistency with Mi Tienda aesthetics, be fully functional, include English code comments, ensure responsiveness, and offer robust Laravel compatibility. A recent critical problem involved a production database desynchronization, where the Laravel backend expected a  table, but the live system utilized a legacy  schema, leading to application failures.

<current_work>
Immediately prior to the current state, the AI engineer successfully migrated database records from  to the  table using . Following this, Laravel routing issues emerged, specifically  and a 404 for . The AI engineer initially attempted a fix by providing a  file that severely truncated the original , inadvertently removing over 600 essential routes.

The user corrected the AI engineer, highlighting that the provided fix was insufficient and that the system's full logic was missing. Through direct user interaction via PuTTY commands, it was confirmed that the live Laravel application is located at , with the Mi Tienda frontend assets residing in . The user also provided the content of their developer's  file, which was analyzed to contain significant duplicate and conflicting route definitions, particularly for  and  prefixed groups, while lacking specific routing for the newly integrated Mi Tienda static HTML pages.

The current work involves the AI engineer providing a detailed, multi-step solution to the user. This solution includes:
1.  Creating a PHP script () to programmatically remove the identified problematic duplicate route sections from the  file.
2.  Explicitly re-injecting the necessary Mi Tienda API routes and static HTML file serving routes into the cleaned  file.
3.  Providing precise  commands for the user to execute via PuTTY to perform these file operations (backup, script creation, execution, and replacement) and then verify the new routes using . The immediate goal is to ensure the core Laravel routes (, ) coexist properly with the new  routes.
