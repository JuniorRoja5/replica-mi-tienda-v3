The trajectory details a comprehensive bug-fixing and feature expansion effort for the Mi Tienda application. Initially, the focus was on resolving a critical Stripe discount pricing bug after an architectural migration of pricing-related fields from a JSON  field to dedicated database columns. This involved iterative debugging across frontend data submission (), backend CRUD operations ( , ), data retrieval for both admin and public interfaces (, ), and finally the Stripe payment intent calculation logic. Once the discount bug was fully resolved across all four product types (digital product, consultation, course, membership), the user requested to implement the Consultation product's scheduling system, starting with a basic custom link approach, leveraging existing  data structure.

<product_requirements>
The Mi Tienda application facilitates selling various product types (digital products, consultations, courses, memberships) via public profiles, with Stripe payments and automated content delivery.

**Custom Fields:**
*   Users can create, edit, and delete custom fields for all product types.
*   Customizable attributes include label, type (text, email, tel, number), placeholder, and 'required' status.
*   End-users can edit these fields on the public product page.
*   Hardcoded Nombre completo and Correo electr√≥nico fields were removed.

**Stripe Discount Pricing (Initially Buggy, Now Fixed):**
*   **Problem:** Discounted prices were displayed in UI but not applied in Stripe transactions. New products saved  and  in the DB.
*   **Architectural Change:** Migrated , , ,  from JSON  to dedicated  table columns.
*   **Implementation:**
    *   Laravel migrations created columns and migrated existing data, correcting inconsistencies (e.g.,  implying ).
    *   Backend , ,  methods updated to read/write these fields to/from dedicated columns, removing them from .
    *   Backend  and  updated to prioritize reading from dedicated columns.
    *   Frontend  updated to send  at the root level for all product types.
    *   Frontend  updated to correctly display and send discounted prices to Stripe.
*   **Current Status:** Discount pricing is fully functional end-to-end for all product types.

**Consultation Product - Scheduling (In Progress):**
*   **Requirement:** Implement a scheduling system for consultation products.
*   **Initial Step:** Start with a basic version using a user-provided custom call link.
*   **Existing Components:** Frontend admin UI (mi-tienda.html) and JavaScript () already support configuring  including  (Google Meet, Zoom, custom), , , , and  (days, intervals). The public page () currently has a placeholder for booking.

**Directory Structure (Simplified relevant parts):**


-   ****
    -   **Importance**: Handles authenticated API operations for Mi Tienda (product CRUD, payment intents, file uploads).
    -   **Changes**:
        -    (lines 737-738): Modified to explicitly cast  to  or  and  to  if no discount, ensuring correct saving of boolean/decimal values to dedicated columns.
        -    (lines 855-856): Same type casting logic applied for updating products.
        -    (lines 585, 591, 592): Modified to prioritize reading , , and  directly from  (database columns) and use  only as a fallback for  values.
        -    (line ~1101): Simplified the discount condition from  to  (truthy evaluation) to correctly process boolean  and integer  from the database.

-   ****
    -   **Importance**: Handles public-facing API data retrieval for Mi Tienda.
    -   **Changes**:
        -    method (lines 21, 26, 27): Modified , , and  to prioritize reading from  (database columns) and use  only as a fallback.

-   **** (NEW)
    -   **Importance**: Adds dedicated columns , , ,  to  table.

-   **** (NEW)
    -   **Importance**: Migrates existing discount data from the  JSON field to the new dedicated columns, with corrected logic for  based on .

    -   **Importance**: Frontend logic for product creation, editing, and UI interactions in the admin panel.
    -   **Changes**: In 12 locations across , , , , , , , , , ,  (for all 4 product types),  was added at the root level of the  object sent to the backend.

-   ****
    -   **Importance**: Public-facing product display page.
    -   **Changes**:
        -   Lines 573-574: Modified to read  and  directly from  and  (from the API response) instead of .
        -   Line ~1000 (within ): Ensures  correctly accounts for  and  before initiating Stripe payment.
        -   Contains a placeholder  function () for consultation products.

-   ****
    -   **Importance**: Admin interface for creating and editing products.
    -   **Changes**: Contains UI elements for configuring  (call method, duration, timezone, weekly availability) for consultation products.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer successfully resolved a critical regression in the Stripe discount pricing functionality, which affected all four product types. This involved a multi-faceted approach:
1.  **Frontend Data Submission ():** Ensured  was explicitly sent at the root level of product data for all create/update operations, addressing a prior issue where it was only within the  JSON.
2.  **Backend Data Persistence ( /):** Corrected type handling for  and  to ensure  was saved as  (integer) and  values were handled correctly in the dedicated database columns.
3.  **Backend Data Retrieval (  and  ):** Updated both the authenticated and public API endpoints to prioritize reading , , and  from their dedicated database columns, with the  JSON serving only as a fallback.
4.  **Frontend Public Display ():** Modified JavaScript to correctly read and display the  and  values from the API response.
5.  **Stripe Payment Intent ( ):** Refined the conditional logic () to robustly check for discounts, correctly interpreting boolean and integer  values from the database, ensuring Stripe charges the correct discounted amount.

All temporary debug logs have been removed. The discount system is now fully functional across all product types, from admin creation/editing to public display and Stripe payment processing. The next task is to begin implementing the booking system for Consultation products, specifically starting with the custom link functionality, leveraging the already existing  data structure.
