The previous AI engineer focused on refining the Mi Tienda application, starting with fixing image URL inconsistencies for links in various contexts. This involved implementing a sophisticated URL handling logic in  and securing admin HTML files with Laravel Gatekeeper. The iterative process revealed similar image display problems for products (Consultoría), leading to the application of the same URL normalization pattern in . A significant part of the trajectory focused on data persistence for Consultoría, specifically addressing missing fields (data hydration) and incorrect payload construction causing fields like 'reviews' and 'custom_fields' to be empty in the public API. The current state is that 'reviews' are fixed, but 'custom_fields' persist as empty, pointing to a probable frontend payload reset issue before submission. The conversation highlights a robust, iterative debugging methodology focusing on pattern identification and replication across product types.

<product_requirements>
The Mi Tienda application is a user profile and digital product CRUD platform where users can manage digital products, consultations, courses, and memberships. Users need a public profile URL () with customizable designs and persistent settings. Key features include rich text editing (Quill.js) for product descriptions with robust server-side image uploads. All product fields (e.g., discount, downloadable files, custom fields, FAQs, reviews, button text, subtitle) must persist, display correctly, and load for editing. In list views, only product title/subtitle should display, with prices hidden. Public product () and user profile () pages must reflect all details, fetching data securely. Critical security vulnerabilities exposing admin panels () must be restricted to authenticated Laravel sessions via iframes. The product not found page's back button should redirect to the user's public profile.

**Directory Structure:**

-   ****: Core frontend logic for the admin panel and product/link CRUD.
    -   **Changes**:
        -   **Line 862**: Modified  mapping for  to handle absolute, relative, and prefixed URLs (, , ). This was the fix for links in the design iframe.
        -   **Line 845**: Modified  mapping for  in  (public-facing) to handle diverse URL formats.
        -   **Lines 938-940**: Removed a reactive patch that fixed duplicate URL prefixes.
        -   **Line ~3905**:  made  and refactored to use  instead of Base64.
        -   **Lines 4695-4797**:  function completely rewritten to correctly populate  from  (data hydration) and to populate all corresponding HTML input fields, Quill editor, image preview, and availability settings.
        -   **Line 1187**: Modified condition for displaying product images in the mobile preview iframe to include .
        -   **Lines ~4470, ~4568, ~4643**: In , , and  functions, fields like , , and  were moved from being nested within the  object to the root level of the  payload sent to the backend.
-   ****: Backend API for user panel interactions.
    -   **Changes**:
        -   **Lines 567-574**: Added an  condition to the URL normalization logic within the  method to correctly handle relative  values (e.g., ) by prepending the full  domain. This resolved historical image 404s in the admin panel.
-   ****: Backend API for public-facing data.
    -   **Current State**: Confirmed to correctly process meta fields (extracting , , , ) and fix duplicate image URLs (lines 22-35 in code). No changes were made in this specific interaction.

<pending_tasks>
- Apply data hydration fix () to  and  functions in .
- Refactor remaining Base64 image uploads in  to use .
- Conduct a full security audit of the entire site after all current changes are implemented.
- Fix the bug where saved design colors do not persist after session closure ( and Laravel routes for Mi Tienda design settings).
- Resolve the  array still being empty in public API responses for , likely due to a frontend payload reset before submission.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer and user were debugging a persistent issue with  remaining empty in the public API response for newly created  products, despite  now appearing correctly.

The debugging process confirmed that:
1.  **Frontend payload construction:** , , and  for  were successfully moved to the root level of the  payload in , , and  functions within .
2.  **Backend processing:**  () correctly expects these fields at the root level and has logic to include them.
3.  **Public API:**  also correctly processes these fields if they are present in the stored  JSON.

However, despite these fixes and tests with newly created consultations,  are still reported as empty arrays in the public API response, while  are now correctly populated. The current hypothesis is that  is being reset or becoming empty at some point within the frontend JavaScript *before* the  payload is finalized and sent to the backend. The UI explicitly shows default 'Nombre completo' and 'Correo electrónico' fields for custom fields, yet these are not persisting.

The last action was the user providing the request for a comprehensive documentation, effectively pausing the debugging process of the  issue.
