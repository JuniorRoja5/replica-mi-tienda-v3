The trajectory details an extensive debugging process for the Mi Tienda application, initially focusing on a persistent  bug in the public API for  products. The AI engineer and user systematically explored frontend payload construction, backend API processing, and database storage. A significant breakthrough occurred when the user, following the AI's detailed documentation and debugging steps, identified the root cause in the  frontend, where  were incorrectly read from  instead of . After resolving this, the focus shifted to applying similar fixes and architectural patterns to Curso Digital. This involved correcting data hydration in , ensuring meta fields were at the root level for  and , refactoring Base64 image uploads, and fixing the editable review functionality. The trajectory concludes with the AI and user still debugging organizational and consistency issues in Curso Digital functions, including unorganized code blocks, mixed payload patterns for , and lingering Base64 image uploads.

<product_requirements>
The Mi Tienda application enables users to manage digital products, consultations, courses, and memberships via a public profile URL (). It requires customizable designs and persistent settings. Core functionalities include rich text editing (Quill.js) for product descriptions with robust server-side image uploads, ensuring all product fields (e.g., discount, downloadable files, custom fields, FAQs, reviews, button text, subtitle) persist, display correctly, and load for editing. List views should only show title/subtitle and hide prices. Public product () and user profile () pages must reflect all details, fetching data securely. Admin panels () are restricted to authenticated Laravel sessions via iframes. The product not found page's back button should redirect to the user's public profile. So far, image URL inconsistencies, iframe display for images, and data hydration for 'Consultoría' have been addressed. The display of  in the public API for  and 'Productos Digitales' was a major bug, resolved by a frontend code change.

**Directory Structure:**

-   ****: Core frontend logic for the admin panel and product/link CRUD.
    -   **Changes**:
        -   **Line 1187**: Modified condition for displaying product images in the mobile preview iframe to include  and .
        -   **Lines ~4470, ~4568, ~4643**: In , , and  functions, fields like , , and  were moved from being nested within the  object to the root level of the  payload.
        -   **Lines 4695-4797 (editConsultation)**: Rewritten to populate  from  (root level) or  (fallback) and populate HTML inputs, Quill editor, image preview, and availability settings.  default structure was corrected.
        -   ** (function block)**: Refactored to use dual-pattern reading () for data hydration, with explicit HTML population and calls to  and .
        -   ** (function block)**: Modified to move , ,  to the root level of the payload.
        -   ** (function block)**: Modified to move , ,  to the root level of the payload.
        -   ** and  (function blocks)**: Converted to  functions and intended to use  instead of Base64 (though this change is currently incomplete/unverified).
        -   ****: Corrected to push empty editable fields to  (instead of hardcoded values) and later to use  instead of .
        -   ****: Corrected to generate editable HTML inputs (text, stars, textarea) based on  pattern.
        -   ****: Added as a missing auxiliary function to update  by index.
        -   ****: Modified to use  instead of .
        -   **File cleanup**: Eliminated multiple duplicated course-related functions like , , , ,  by keeping only the corrected versions.
-   ****: Frontend file for public product display.
    -   **Changes**:
        -   **Line ~562**: Corrected  to  to correctly display custom fields from the public API.
-   ****: Backend API for user panel interactions.
    -   **Changes**:
        -   **Lines 567-574**: Added an  condition to the URL normalization logic within  to handle relative  values by prepending the full domain. This ensures image URLs are absolute for admin display.
-   ****: Backend API for public-facing data.
    -   **Current State**: The code has been refined several times during debugging. The final version selected for production is clean, without debug fields, and correctly processes  for , , , , , , and , placing them at the root level of the product array returned in the JSON payload. Image URL correction logic is also present.
    -   **Routes**:  defines the public route  mapping to .

<pending_tasks>
-   Refactor  to use  (still uses Base64).
-   Refactor  to use .
-   Organize  and  functions into the designated Curso Digital code block in .
-   Ensure all course-related functions (especially , , ) consistently use root-level payload for complex meta fields like , , and . (Initial changes were made, but inconsistencies were noted).
-   Apply data hydration fix () to  function in .
-   Conduct a full security audit of the entire site after all current changes are implemented.
-   Fix the bug where saved design colors do not persist after session closure ( and Laravel routes for Mi Tienda design settings).
-   Implement functionality for Membresía Recurrente.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary, the AI engineer and user were debugging and fixing the Curso Digital product type.
The work involved:
1.  **Code Organization**: Identifying and eliminating duplicated course-related JavaScript functions (, , , , ) from . However,  and  are still loose (unorganized) outside their intended section.
2.  **Payload Structure**: Correcting  to send , , and  at the root level of the  payload, rather than nested in . However, the trajectory indicates that mixed patterns still exist across course functions for payload construction.
3.  **Image Upload**:  and  were supposed to be refactored from Base64 to , but the latest checks show this change is still not fully implemented or verified.
4.  **Review Editing**: The , , , and  functions were fixed to allow editable review fields in the course modal, similar to .  was identified as missing and added.
5.  **Iframe Image Display**: The condition in  (line 1187) was updated to include  so course images display correctly in the mobile preview iframe.
The current status is that the review editing for courses has been addressed, but unorganized functions, inconsistent payload patterns, and Base64 image uploads for courses are still outstanding.
