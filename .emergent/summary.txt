The trajectory outlines an extensive debugging and integration effort for a Mi Tienda application, transitioning from  to a Laravel API backend. Initial work focused on basic Laravel authentication via URL parameters, which was plagued by file duplication and persistent caching issues on the SiteGround server, requiring significant diagnostic efforts. After resolving caching, the focus shifted to API data loading and saving for user profiles and products. A critical bug was identified: while the backend successfully saves profile data, the frontend was not correctly loading and displaying it due to a fundamental issue in the  function. This function was found to populate UI text but fail to set actual input element values, leading to local  being overwritten by stale/default input values, making changes seem to disappear on refresh.

<product_requirements>
The primary goal is to re-implement the Mi Tienda application, initially in React, using vanilla HTML/CSS/JS, fully integrating with a Laravel Blade backend. It must maintain its original design and Spanish localization. All client-side  operations must migrate to RESTful API calls for user profile management, full CRUD operations for products (including drag-and-drop reordering), public product display, and various administrative sections. Authentication and data transfer between the main Laravel Blade page and the Mi Tienda iframe must use URL parameters with secure CSRF token handling. The Laravel backend APIs for profile and product management exist and are functional. The current task is to fully integrate these APIs into the user's provided vanilla JS frontend for all interactive elements, without altering the fundamental HTML/JS file structure, and resolve data persistence issues.

<key_technical_concepts>
-   **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (Vanilla), Iframe communication, DOM manipulation.
-   **Backend**: Laravel (Blade, MVC, Routing, Controllers, Eloquent, CSRF).
-   **Integration**: URL Parameters for authentication, RESTful API calls (),  (for fallback).
-   **Server**: Apache/Nginx (SiteGround specific caching), PHP.
</key_technical_concepts>

<code_architecture>
**Directory Structure:**


-   ****: Defines general web routes and *some* API routes. It was found to contain duplicate API routes for  that were protected by CSRF middleware, conflicting with .
-   ****: Defines authenticated Mi Tienda API routes, explicitly excluding CSRF middleware. This is the intended API route file.
-   ****: Handles backend logic for Mi Tienda profile and product management.
    -   **Changes Made**: The  function was extensively modified to correctly update ,  (from ), , , and  in the  model. It also ensures user's top-level  is updated for consistency.
-   ****: Main Laravel Blade view, embedding  as an iframe and passing authentication data (CSRF, user_id, name, email) via URL parameters.
-   ****: The main HTML file for the Mi Tienda frontend, loaded in an iframe. It references .
-   ****: Contains the vanilla JavaScript logic for the Mi Tienda admin frontend. This is the **correct and currently being modified version based on user's provided file**.
    -   **Changes Made**:
        -   **Authentication**: Added  object, , and  for authentication from URL parameters.
        -   **Initialization**: Modified  to call  first.
        -   **Data Loading**: Added , ,  to fetch data from Laravel APIs.
        -   **Save Logic**: Modified  to bypass  if authenticated.
        -   **Profile Save**: Replaced  to use API for authenticated users and added  for profile updates.
        -   **Error Handling**: Fixed a syntax error in a comment for .
    -   **Current Status**: Authentication, API data loading, and profile saving to the backend are functional. The issue of UI changes not persisting is related to event listeners in the profile modal.
-   ****: Was attempted to be created to enforce no-caching but caused a 500 error on the SiteGround server and was subsequently removed. Caching is now handled by user through cPanel (NGINX Direct Delivery).

-   Modify  in  to correctly populate form inputs with  values and ensure event listeners are correctly bound to update  in real-time.
-   Integrate functions for creating and updating products (, , , etc.) with the new  and  functions.
-   Integrate drag & drop reordering ().
-   Integrate delete product functionality ().
-   Address image upload integration with the  for avatar and product images.
-   Verify full end-to-end functionality for all CRUD operations, drag-and-drop reordering, and profile updates with the Laravel backend.

<current_work>
The immediate work involved diagnosing and resolving a critical data persistence bug affecting user profile updates (name, username, avatar, social links).
It was confirmed that:
1.  The backend  was successfully updated to save all profile fields (name, slug/username, bio, avatar_path, social_links).
2.  Frontend API calls () were correctly sending data and receiving successful responses from the backend (HTTP 200).
3.  Frontend API data loading () was correctly fetching updated profile data from the backend.
However, when a user made changes in the profile modal () and refreshed the page, those changes were not persisting (except for the bio field). The root cause was identified to be in : the  function, responsible for initializing the profile modal and attaching event listeners, was only updating the  of display elements, not the  attributes of the actual input fields. This meant that when , , etc., were triggered, they were reading stale or empty values from the inputs, overriding the correct data loaded from the Laravel API. The  was therefore not being updated correctly by user input.
