The previous AI engineer successfully executed a major refactoring, migrating a React application's Mi Tienda section to vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for Laravel Blade integration. This involved re-implementing core product features, resolving modal bugs, and developing new Dashboard and Ingresos sections, meticulously replicating React counterparts. A significant effort was dedicated to the Diseño (Design) section, including theme customization and real-time iframe preview, which required extensive bug fixes for CSS conflicts, font application, and public page consistency. Most recently, Customers and Statistics sections were implemented and integrated. The work consistently prioritized Laravel compatibility, Spanish UI, and English code comments. The immediate focus shifted to debugging a critical production database desynchronization issue, with the engineer beginning analysis of provided SQL dumps and the GitHub repository to resolve schema discrepancies.

<product_requirements>
The primary objective was to re-implement the Mi Tienda section of a React application using vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, ensuring seamless integration with a Laravel Blade backend. This re-implementation needed to match existing designs, be fully functional in Spanish, and include features such as product/link creation, drag-and-drop reordering, user profile editing with real-time iframe updates, and multi-tabbed forms for Llamada, Curso, and Membresía. Design enhancements and bug fixes were required to address modal overlay conflicts and visual inconsistencies. Subsequently, new sections were commissioned: Dashboard (statistics, charts), Ingresos (income, order history), and Diseño (design customizer with theme/color/font pickers and live iframe preview). The Diseño section specifically needed real-time interaction with Mi Tienda and design consistency across public product pages. Later additions included Customers (contact management) and Statistics (graphs, product summary, devices), also replicated from the original React app. All implementations required consistency with the Mi Tienda aesthetic, full functionality, English code comments, responsiveness, and robust Laravel compatibility.

<pending_tasks>
The most critical pending task is to analyze and resolve a production database desynchronization issue. The currently deployed Laravel code expects a database schema with  and related tables, but the live database still utilizes the legacy  schema, causing the application to fail. The next step is to analyze the provided GitHub repository and SQL dump files ( and ) to thoroughly understand the database schema differences.

<current_work>
Immediately prior to this summary, the AI engineer completed the development and integration of new Customers and Statistics sections, alongside resolving several critical bugs across the application.

**Completed Work:**
1.  **New Section Implementation:** Full replication of Customers and Statistics from the original React application, including their UI, mock data handling, and specific components like graphs and product summaries.
2.  **Bug Resolution:**
    *   **CSS Conflict in Product Previews:** Addressed by replacing hardcoded CSS with dynamic CSS variables in  and integrating JavaScript listeners in  to apply design settings from the Diseño section, ensuring real-time consistency on public pages.
    *   **Font Selection & Application:** Corrected by adding Google Fonts links to  and  and adjusting the z-index of the font dropdown in .
    *   **Public Page Design Consistency:** Ensured  fully integrates with the design system, reflecting Diseño changes on public profile pages ().
    *   **Chart.js Loading & Execution:** Resolved in the Statistics section by correcting loading order and downgrading Chart.js to version 3.9.1 to fix ES6 module syntax errors.
    *   **JavaScript Loading & MIME Type Issues:** Fixed JavaScript file paths in  and  to use relative paths (e.g., ). The  (FastAPI backend) was updated to serve  and  directories correctly, ensuring proper MIME types.
    *   **Persistent Loading Spinners:** Eliminated simulated delays from  and  for immediate data loading.
3.  **Documentation Update:** A comprehensive Laravel integration guide () and a  were created, detailing implemented sections, architecture, and integration points.

**Current Focus (Database Desynchronization):** The immediate focus has shifted to analyzing a critical production database desynchronization issue. The new Laravel code expects a  table structure, while the live database uses . The engineer has successfully gained access to the GitHub repository () and downloaded the two critical SQL dump files ( and ) provided by the user, which represent the new and old schema respectively. The current task is to meticulously analyze these artifacts to pinpoint schema differences and devise a migration strategy.
